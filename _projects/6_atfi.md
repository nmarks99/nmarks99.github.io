# Automated Composite Layup System

This device was desgined, built, and tested during my internship
at Applied Thin Films Inc. during the my time working there from
July 2021 until September 2022.

This project allowed me to utilize my skills and aquire new ones
relating to designing systems that feature mechanical and electrical
components functioning together. In addition to the physical elements
of this machine, I wrote a G-code generator and simulator in Python to
create patterns for the device to execute.
